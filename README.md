# simple-sign

## Purpose
Make signing contract a little bit clearer, and less boring.


## Usage
Copy and paste your textual contract in the angular frontend interface, and we will generate a human-readable (and hopefully interactive) contract in google form.


## Subsystems

NLP system finds keywords and conditions that is not suitable for you and save you sometime dropping them away.

Friendly frontend helps you generate a interactive contract in a click.

Google form integration displays your easy-to-use contract and you can distribute it easily!
